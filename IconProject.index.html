      <h1>The Five Biggest Challenges Facing NYC Cyclists</h1>
      <h2>by Catherine Montesi</h2>

    After years of activism by transportation advocacy groups like Transportation Alternatives and Bridges for People, on September 14, 2021, the Department of Transportation took a lane from the vehicle side of the Brooklyn Bridge and converted into a two-way bike lane connecting Brooklyn to Manhattan.

  Big projects like this make it seem like the city is embracing cycling in the era of climate change, but the reality is that it is still very difficult to be a cyclist in New York City. Community board meetings have become heated battle grounds where car-owning residents see cyclists as a threat to public safety and to their free on-street parking.


<h3>  Here are the biggest challenges currently facing New York City cyclists:</h3>

      <div class="text">2) Although the city has added over 30 miles of bike lanes since 2020, only a fraction are "protected," or seperated from cars by a permanent, physical barrier.</div>


      <div class="images">
        <img src="images/education.png" alt="Drawing of a brain hovering over an open hand."></div>
      <div class="text">3) Besides sporadic tweets and instagram posts, there is currenly no city-wide PR campaign to educate either drivers or cyclists about how to safely share the road.

      <div class="text">5) Transit activists argue that the biggest difference between other large cities that have improved cycling infrastructure and New York City is simply political will.</div>
